# Initial Concept

Meta-RL Scientist is a sophisticated, closed-loop simulation where AI agents act as **Reinforcement Learning Researchers**. These agents autonomously read literature, maintain causal models, and learn to execute parallel experiments through a recurrent neural network "Brain."

# Product Definition

## Core Goals
- Simulate the full lifecycle of scientific research, including literature review, hypothesis generation, and experimentation.

## Key Capabilities
- **Autonomous Literature Review:** Agents can read, synthesize, and utilize existing research.
- **Causal Modeling:** Agents maintain and update internal causal models of their environment and research topic.
- **Parallel Experimentation:** Execution of experiments is managed by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) "Brain" allowing for concurrent processing.

## Target Audience
- AI Researchers and Academics.

## Success Metrics
- Stable convergence of the agent's internal causal model.
- Demonstration of high novelty in the resulting discoveries or hypotheses.

## Research Domains
- Coding and software synthesis.
- Philosophical reasoning and logic.
- Complex systems demonstrating emergence from chaos.
